    "1. Develop a description of the energetics for the system in question.\n",
    "For a magnetic system, one might develop an expression for the total energy\n",

    "2. Develop an algorithm for transitions between microstates.  Make sure\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Evolve the system according to the dynamics you have developed for some\n",

    "**assumed**.  The time steps do not necessarily correspond to \n",
    "steps in \"real\" time. Referring to Fig. 1, for example, we note that the\n",

    "### Simple model for a binary alloy\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that we wish to study the properties of a simple 2D alloy.\n",
    "For simplicity, we will restrict the atoms to reside on the sites of a\n",
    "simple square lattice.  We consider a system that has two types of\n",

    "two B atoms has the energy $\\varepsilon_{BB}$.  Finally, a bond\n",
    "between an A atom and a B atom has the energy $\\varepsilon_{AB}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a variable $\\sigma_{i,j}=\\pm 1$ at each site of the lattice,\n",

    "The model described in Eq. (\\ref{2DIsing}) is known as the 2D Ising\n",
    "Model.   It holds a unique place in the history of statistical\n",

    "interpreting the model as an alloy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Metropolis algorithm for the 2D Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that the best way to understand  Monte Carlo techniques\n",
    "is to implement one, and that is what you will do. You can code the\n",
    "model in your own favorite programming language, but the code must be\n",
    "yours - do not simply find one on the web.   I suggest using either\n",
    "Matlab or Mathematica, but you are free to use whatever language you\n",
    "want, as long as there are sufficiently sophisticated math libraries\n",
    "that include a good random number generator, and, perhaps, functions\n",
    "for computing correlations. A word of caution, though.  Monte Carlo simulations\n",
    "can require substantial computer resources to produce reliable\n",
    "results.  Keep this in mind when choosing your computational\n",
    "platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we will calculate the properties of the 2-D Ising model using\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulation methods.  We have already taken the first step in\n",
    "this endeavor - we've developed an expression for the energy of the\n",
    "microstates.  The next step is the development of an algorithm which\n",
    "insures that Eq. (\\ref{rates}) is obeyed at all times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm we are about to discuss was developed by Metropolis and\n",
    "coworkers in 1953, and hence is known\n",
    "as the Metropolis algorithm (see original paper posted on the bcourses\n",
    "site).  The steps taken are the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Establish an initial configuration of moments. One may give the moments\n",
    "random (with respect to up or down) orientations, \n",
    "or one may start with some predetermined configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select a moment within the lattice at random.  Compute the\n",
    "  change in energy associated with flipping the spin, $\\Delta E \\left\n",
    "    ( \\sigma_{i,j}\\rightarrow -\\sigma_{i,j} \\right )$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If $\\Delta E \\leq 0$, \\emph{i.e.} the energy decreases upon\n",
    "  flipping the moment, ''accept'' the change.  That is, assume that\n",
    "  the next microstate in the Monte Carlo trajectory is the one you\n",
    "  generated by flipping the spin.  If $\\Delta E > 0$, ''accept'' the\n",
    "  new configuration with a probability given by $\\exp (-\\beta \\Delta\n",
    "  E)$.  This can be accomplished by generating a random number $\\eta$,\n",
    "  and comparing it with $\\exp (-\\beta \\Delta E)$.  If $\\eta <\\exp\n",
    "  (-\\beta \\Delta E)$ accept the new configuration as the next in the\n",
    "  trajectory, otherwise, keep the original configuration as the next\n",
    "  in the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compute quantities of interest for this step in the trajectory.\n",
    "  You will want to compute the magnetization and the total energy at\n",
    "  each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Repeat from step 2 as often as ''necessary.'' \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Analyze the results of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This procedure sounds simple enough, and in fact, it is. But there are\n",
    "significant details that need to be addressed.  For example, though\n",
    "the dynamics we employ assuredly take the system to equilibrium, the\n",
    "initial configuration of spins is typically far from equilibrium.  It\n",
    "is necessary, therefore, to run a number of steps before assuming that\n",
    "the microstates correspond to those associated with the equilibrium\n",
    "distribution.  Unfortunatley, estimating the number of steps required\n",
    "to equilibrate is non-trivial (though we discuss this below).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ''random'' numbers\n",
    "Random numbers lie at the heart of our Monte Carlo enterprise.  There\n",
    "is one obvious difficulty, however.  Computers are deterministic -\n",
    "given a specific code, the same input always produces the same output\n",
    "(in this case we include as inputs things that the code might read\n",
    "from a clock etc.)  So numbers generated by a computer are {\\em never}\n",
    "truly random.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, given the importance of generating apparently random numbers,\n",
    "the coding and mathematics communities have put some effort into\n",
    "generating numbers that for our intents and purposes appear random.\n",
    "The details of the most advanced methods are beyond the scope of this\n",
    "course.  However, we can describe the simple random number generators\n",
    "that were used in times passed, and note that modern instances retain\n",
    "some similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the generation of random numbers is accomplished through \n",
    "a discrete mapping. According to the authors of\n",
    "*Numerical Recipes*,\\footnote{William H. Press, Saul A. Teukolsky, William T. Vetterling, and Brian P. Flannery, \\emph{Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing}, Third Edition, 2007 Cambridge University Press, ISBN-10: 0521880688.}  a typical mapping appears like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    " I_{j+1} =\\mbox{mod}(a I_j,m)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the function mod is used to return the remainder of the first argument\n",
    "divided by the second.  The result of this calculation is an integer between\n",
    "0 and $m-1$, inclusive.  Note that these numbers are necessarily\n",
    "periodic - at most,\n",
    "one can generate one of m possible answers.  It turns out that the quality of\n",
    "the random number generator is determined by the values chosen for $a$ and for\n",
    "$m$.  According to Park and Miller\\footnote{S. K. \n",
    "Park and K. W. Miller, \\emph{Communications of the ACM} \\underline{31}, \n",
    "1192 (1988), as quoted in \n",
    "\\emph{Numerical Recipes}.} the optimal choice for 32 bit\n",
    "machines is $a=16807$ and $m = 2^{31}-1 = 2147483647$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern random number generators are much more sophisticated, but most\n",
    "still rely on a seed and are periodic (at least in principle ... the\n",
    "periods are so large that one cannot typically verify this directly).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our work then, we will assume that you will use the best random\n",
    "number generator available to you, and that this random number\n",
    "generator will be sufficiently sophisticated so as to produce a string\n",
    "of reliably random numbers for our simulations. This is certainly true of the\n",
    "random number generators in Matlab and Mathematica.\n",
    "\n",
    "### finite size effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout our discussion of statistical mechanics we have assumed\n",
    "that our experimental system has an enormous number of degrees of\n",
    "freedom.  In conducting Monte Carlo simulations, we are constrained by\n",
    "computational resources to consider systems with only a relatively\n",
    "small number of degrees of freedom.  It is natural then, to consider\n",
    "what effect, if any, the finite size of our simulation might have on\n",
    "our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this respect, the physics of the phase transition in the 2D Ising\n",
    "model is of interest.  First we note that at high temperatures, the\n",
    "magnetization of the model should approach zero.  At these\n",
    "temperatures, thermal fluctuations become significant, and the spins,\n",
    "in general, become quite disordered.  Another way to see this is to\n",
    "examine the algorithm that we discussed above.  As\n",
    "$T\\rightarrow\\infty$, $\\beta\\rightarrow 0$.  The result is that the probability\n",
    "to accept any spin flip goes to $1$, and the thermodynamic average of\n",
    "any spin approaches zero as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the temperature is reduced from $\\infty$, spin flips that increase\n",
    "the energy are accepted with a reduced probability.  Thus spins will\n",
    "begin to align with their neighboring spins (for a ferromagnetic\n",
    "interaction) and domains in which the spins are aligned will become\n",
    "apparent. At higher temperatures, these domains will be small, and\n",
    "will fluctuate quite rapidly in time.  However, as the temperature is\n",
    "decreased, the domain size will, in fact, increase.  Eventually, at a\n",
    "critical value of the temperature known as $T_c$, the domain size will\n",
    "diverge.  The temperature demarcates the temperature boundary of the\n",
    "phase transition to the ferromagnetic phase.  Below $T_c$, the system\n",
    "will display ferromagnetism.  Above $T_c$, the system is a paramagnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain size can be explored mathematically.  Define the spin-spin\n",
    "correlation, $g_{\\sigma}(\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j)$, to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "g_{\\sigma}(\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j)=\\frac{\\langle\n",
    "  \\sigma_{i+\\Delta_i,j+\\Delta_j}\\sigma_{i,j} \\rangle -\\langle\n",
    "  \\sigma_{i,j} \\rangle^2 }{\\langle\n",
    "  \\sigma_{i,j}^2  \\rangle -\\langle\n",
    "  \\sigma_{i,j} \\rangle^2 }\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\langle A \\rangle$ denotes the thermodynamic average of the\n",
    "quantity $A$.  Briefly, this function measures the\n",
    "response of the system to perturbations. More specifically, if you\n",
    "were to perturb a system at the origin, say by holding it fixed in the\n",
    "up position, this function measures how strongly this perturbation is\n",
    "felt at the point $\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j$.  Typically, we expect that\n",
    "$g_{\\sigma}(\\Delta_i,\\Delta_j) \\sim \\exp \\left (\n",
    "  -\\sqrt{\\Delta_i^2+\\Delta_j^2}/\\xi \\right )$, with $\\xi$ the\n",
    "correlation length.  This correlation length serves as a good measure\n",
    "of the domain size the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with finite sized systems, then, becomes readily\n",
    "apparent. If the correlation length of the system diverges in an\n",
    "infinite system, then at some point, the same correlation length\n",
    "becomes equal to the size of our finite sized system.  This implies\n",
    "that our predictions must be impacted by our choice of size for the\n",
    "system. The periodic boundary conditions limit the physical\n",
    "fluctuations within the model to wavelengths shorter than the size of\n",
    "the system - this limit does not exist in the macroscopic object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The truncation of fluctuations due to finite size affects our\n",
    "predictions.  First and foremost, the divergence of the correlation\n",
    "length that demarcates the temperature $T_c$ is no longer possible -\n",
    "our finite size model does not, formally, display a phase transition.\n",
    "This means that one of the quantities we may be very interested in,\n",
    "$T_c$, is not directly measurable. (Finite size scaling, however,\n",
    "enables us to estimate these effects directly.)\n",
